# xrandrctl
python 3 wrapper for `xrandr` to control screen brightness and colour

This script stores the current values of the `brightness` and `gamma` properties for outputs recognised by the `xrandr` program in a JSON document. The script then makes an appropriate call to `xrandr` to change the brightness and/or gamma values of an output by a certain delta. This can be used as a simple tool to control the 'temperature' of your screens. 

Example use:
```
python xrandrctl.py HDMI-1 --brighter --bluer
```

The available options are
`--brighter`,
`--dimmer`,
`--redder`,
`--bluer`, and 
`--reset`,
with obvious meanings.

For those without multiple monitors or the need to control the brightness/gamma of multiple monitors individually, you may want to use the 'mini' version of this wrapper: [`minixrandrctl`.](#minixrandrctl)

### Setup
Copy `xrandr_current_values.json` from `example_json` into the directory containing `xrandrctl.py`. This JSON document contains an array of objects (comma separated), each describing one output recognised as 'connected' by `xrandr`.
The only fields absolutely required in each dictionary are the `output`, `brightness` and `gamma` fields. `output` is the name of the connected display as listed by running `xrandr`. For example, `"output": "DVI-I-1"`. `brightness` is the saved brightness of the display, which should be `1` before you first run the script. Similarly, `gamma` is the remembered value of the R:G:B gamma triplet for the display as an array of floats and has a starting value of `[1,1,1]`.

Optional fields for an output:
- `alias` - a string that may be used to refer to that output
- `brightness_delta` - a float describing the amount to increment or decrement the value of brightness by (default `0.1`)
- `gamma_delta` - a list of floats describing the amount to increment or decrement the value of gamma by (default `[0,0.025,0.05]`)

An example entry utilising all three optional fields would be
```json
  {
    "alias": "secondary",
    "output": "HDMI-1",
    "brightness": 1.0,
    "gamma": [
      1.0,
      1.0,
      1.0
    ],
    "brightness_delta": 0.15,
    "gamma_delta": [
      0,
      0.03,
      0.06
    ]
  }
```
(You can use an editor plugin or on-line tool to 'prettify' the JSON and check for valid syntax.)

### Control
To increase the brightness and blue values of the output `DVI-D-1`
```
python xrandrctl.py DVI-D-1 --brighter --bluer
```
or, if it has the `alias` 'primary',
```
python xrandrctl.py primary --brighter --bluer
```
To do the above while also decreasing the brightness and blue values of an output with the alias 'secondary'
```
python xrandrctl.py primary --brighter --bluer secondary --dimmer --redder
```

In each case, the commands increment or decrement the brightness and gamma values according to the deltas for that output in `xrandr_current_values.json`, if specified (otherwise the default values defined in `xrandrctl.py` are used).

A bash alias is handy here. For example,
```sh
~/.bashrc
---------
alias xrandctl="python ~/my_scripts/xrandrctl.py"
```
You may also like to make key bindings for running `xrandctl` with various options (see `i3_config_snippet` for an example of a set of keybindings for the i3 window manager).

To change the brightness or gamma of _all_ outputs added to `xrandr_current_values.json`, simply omit naming the output or its alias. For example,
```
python xrandrctl.py --dimmer
```

Finally, the `--reset` option restores the brightness and gamma of an output to their original values (`1.0` and `1:1:1`), with
```
python xrandrctl.py --reset
```
restoring the brightness and gamma of every output.


# minixrandrctl
`minixrandrctl.py` is a stripped down version of `xrandrctl.py` which doesn't allow for changing the brightness and gamma values different screens independtly, but is quicker to set up for someone without need of such control.

## Setup
Copy `minixrandr_current_values.json` from `example_json` into the directory containing `minixrandrctl.py`. This file contains a single JSON object. Simply add any connected `xrandr` outputs you wish to be controlled to the comma separated array `outputs` (run `xrandr` to determine the name of any output(s) you have). The `brightness` and `gamma` fields should not be edited.

## Control
The brightness and colour of all screens may be changed by passing the `--brighter`, `--dimmer`, `--redder`, `--bluer` or `--reset` options as arguemnts of `minixrandrctl.py`. For example,
```
python minixrandrctly.py --dimmer --redder
```
reduces the brightness and blue content across all outputs listed in `minixrandr_current_values.json`.

## Notes
The decision was made to store brightness and gamma values independtely of the `xrandr` program because of how long it takes to poll the latter - spot the `brightness` and `gamma` proprties in `xrandr --verbose` (the gamma values do not appear to be correct on my system). The one downside is that a discrepancy may arise between the stored values and the actual values, if the user decides to set the values directly using `xrandr` or the values are reset due to a system reboot, for example (this disparity will only last until the next call to `xrandrctl.py`). A simple workaround is to add a call to `xrandctl.py` (or `minixrandctl.py`) to reset the values of all outputs in a start-up or login script such as `~/.bash_profile`:
```
python xrandctl.py --reset
```

By default, both `xrandrctly.py` and `minixrandrctly.py` log any output from `xrandr` (and other information) to files by the same name but with a `.log` extension. The logging level may be changed or logging stopped entirely by editing the relevant lines at the top of either script.
